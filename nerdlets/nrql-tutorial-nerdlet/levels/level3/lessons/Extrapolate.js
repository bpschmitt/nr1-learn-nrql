        The New Relic Database (NRDB) receives and processes enormous amounts of
        data, every day, at lightning speed! When APM records a large amount of
        event data, New Relic agents implement a sampling technique to continue
        collecting meaningful data while reducing potential impact to your
        applications. This usually only happens when a single event in an
        application or service handles extremely high volumes of requests. If
        multiple agents are spread across multiple load-balanced instances of a
        service, this limit might never be observed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's discuss what we can do when this happens. The{' '}
        <code>EXTRAPOLATE</code> operator tells New Relic to mathematically
        compensate for the effects of sampling, thereby returning results that
        more closely represent activity in your system. We store an extra value
        to record how many similar events occured over the limit. This allows
        New Relic to deliver statistically accurate results.
      </p>

      <SampleQuery
        nrql="SELECT count(\*) FROM Transaction SINCE 60 minutes ago FACET appName TIMESERIES 1 minute **EXTRAPOLATE**"
        span="12"
      />

      <p>
        You might be thinking "are we hitting the limit?" Well, try removing{' '}
        <code>EXTRAPOLATE</code> from the query, and see if your count changes.
        If it doesn't, you most likely haven't reached the limit.
      </p>

      <h2>Lesson Summary</h2>
      <p>
        When <code>EXTRAPOLATE</code> is included in a query, the ratio between
        the reported events and the total events is calculated. This ratio is
        then used to extrapolate an approximation of unsampled data. Keep in
        mind that only some queries support its use. When included in a NRQL
        query that doesnâ€™t support it, or that doesn't use sampled data, it will
        have no effect.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that <code>EXTRAPOLATE</code> is most useful for homogenous data
        (like throughput or error rate). It's not effective when attempting to
        extrapolate a count of distinct things (like <code>uniqueCount()</code>{' '}
        or <code>uniques()</code>). This clause works only with NRQL queries
        that use one of the following aggregator functions:

      <ul>
        <li>apdex</li>
        <li>average</li>
        <li>count</li>
        <li>histogram</li>
        <li>sum</li>
        <li>percentage</li>
        <li>rate</li>
        <li>stddev</li>
      </ul>
