        example queries and explanations with your own data helps you understand
        how you can transform your event data to incredibly powerful visuals. Be
        sure you try out some of the queries on your own data on different event
        types to really understand their power.

        EXTRAPOLATE keyword, filtering aggregation functions and how to override
        values.
